# Deskewing

# When we write, we often write at angles to the paper, which cause letters and numbers to be skewed.
# Unfortunately, unlike the human eye, computers cannot easily find similarities between images that are transformations of each other.
# Thus, the process of deskewing helps in recognition.

#Very formally, deskewing is the process of straightening an image that has been scanned or written crookedly â€” that is an image that is slanting too far in one direction, or one that is misaligned.

# This is the code which is taken from the internet.
